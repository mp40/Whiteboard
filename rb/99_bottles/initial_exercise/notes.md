### Initial Exercise

As with the JS version which I did first, just passed tests one by one then refactored. I course the ruby version had the benifit of being done after the JS version and then reading the first chapter of the JS pdf. 

Slight difference in that I used a switch statement. Also used `chomp`, which I have to say was very handy.

#### Shameless Green
The Shamless Green solution easily answers the following cost/value questions as follows:
##### How difficult was this to write?
It was easy to write (especially with the a nice test suite to help)
##### How hard is it to understand?
Pretty easy
##### How expensive will it be to change?
Cheap to change, if one verse changes it easy to keep the others in sync.
