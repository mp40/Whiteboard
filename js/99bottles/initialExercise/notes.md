### Initial Exercise

As per instructions did the initial exercise one test at a time before reading chapter one.

Since tests were already provided, used TDD principle of easiest change to make the test green.

Completed within the 30 minutes stipulated. Though admittedly I missed an easy refactor.

When went through the examples in chaper one, mine was closest to the type described as "Shameless Green". The main difference being I didn't bother using the provided helper method.
