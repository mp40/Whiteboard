### Initial Exercise

As per instructions did the initial exercise one test at a time before reading chapter one.

Since tests were already provided, used TDD principle of easiest change to make the test green.

When went through the examples in chaper one, mine was closest to the type described as "Shameless Green". The main difference being I didn't bother using the provided helper method.
